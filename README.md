# Neural Network Visualization

This is a mathematica notebook I created to visually represent a neural network with 2 input neurons, 2 hidden neurons, and 1 output neuron. You can use the sliding bars to adjust the weights to see how it effects the function. I also display a density plot that has the input 1 on the x axis and the input 2 on the y axis. This way you can see on a 2d and 3d plot of how the network comes to conclusions.
